# WeatherApp
WeatherApp is a JavaScript and jQuery application that will display the temperature, wind-speed, UV-index, and humidity for a city (which is typed into the search bad on the left-hand side of the screen). The application uses an API provided by the Open Weather Map as a means to retrieve and display data in a variety of categories, including a five-day planner. The application is styled with Bootstraps's "Materia" theme to provide a bright and user-friendly experience for those using the application.
